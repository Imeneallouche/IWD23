Inspiration

  Our project was inspired by the childhood experiences of one of our team members, who suffered from bullying but had no one to turn to for support. This led to various mental health issues, such as depression, low self-esteem, and fear. She wished she had a way to talk to someone anonymously about her problems, without fear of judgment or gossip.

  We wanted to create a virtual world of mental health therapy, especially in our country where people are often hesitant to see a psychologist due to the social stigma attached to it.

What it Does

Our platform aims to help people struggling with mental health issues by providing three key functionalities:

  - An emotional chatbot, developed using an AI model, that assists users in understanding their feelings and shows empathy.

  - An advisor model that analyzes a user's symptoms during conversations and provides daily life advice to help improve their situation.

  - A premium functionality that allows users to chat anonymously with expert therapists.

  - In addition, our platform can also benefit therapists, who can use the chatbot to help diagnose patients by asking the right questions related to therapy.

How We Built It

We used various technologies to build our platform:

  - Backend: Django, Django Rest Framework, MySQL
  - Frontend: ReactJS with Vite and TailwindCSS
  - AI: Python and the ChatGPT API

We used Django and Django Rest Framework for our backend, which handles the storage of user data and communication with the AI and chatbot. ReactJS with Vite and TailwindCSS were used for the frontend, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. Finally, we used Python and the ChatGPT API for the AI model and chatbot functionalities.

Overall, we're proud of what we've built and believe it can have a positive impact on people's mental health.
